To get a signal when the mouse leaves the QCustomPlot widget, you can use the leaveEvent() function
provided by the QWidget class, which QCustomPlot inherits from. Here’s an example of how you can do it:


class MyCustomPlot : public QCustomPlot
{
    Q_OBJECT

public:
    MyCustomPlot(QWidget *parent = 0) : QCustomPlot(parent)
    {
        // Initialization code here
    }

protected:
    void leaveEvent(QEvent *event)
    {
        // Signal that the mouse has left the widget
        emit mouseLeft();
        QCustomPlot::leaveEvent(event);
    }

signals:
    void mouseLeft();
};


In this code, MyCustomPlot is a subclass of QCustomPlot. We override the leaveEvent() function to emit a mouseLeft signal
whenever the mouse leaves the widget. You can then connect this signal to any slot you want to respond to this event.

Remember to replace all instances of QCustomPlot in your code with MyCustomPlot to use this new functionality.
Also, don’t forget to include the necessary Qt headers and use the Q_OBJECT macro in your class definition to enable
Qt’s meta-object system, which is required for signals and slots to work.
